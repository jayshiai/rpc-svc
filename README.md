# Distributed File Manager using Linux RPC (Sun RPC / ONC RPC)

A simple client-server file management system using Sun RPC for distributed communication.

## Operations (4 functions)

1. **Upload** - Upload a file to server
2. **Download** - Download a file from server
3. **List** - List all files on server
4. **Delete** - Delete a file from server

## Build

```bash
make all
```

## Running Locally (macOS / no portmapper)

```bash
# Terminal 1 - Start server with fixed port
./bin/filemanager_server 8085

# Terminal 2 - Connect client
./bin/filemanager_client localhost:8085
```

## Running on Linux (with portmapper)

```bash
# On server (Linux)
sudo systemctl start rpcbind
./bin/filemanager_server

# On client (any machine)
./bin/filemanager_client <server-ip>
```
